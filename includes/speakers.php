        <p>Web Architect and standards evangelist at Yahoo UK: <em>Frontloaded and zipped up - do loose types sink ships</em>.</p>
        <p>Christian Heilmann is a geek and hacker by heart. He's been a professional web developer for about eleven years and worked his way through several agencies up to Yahoo where he delivered Yahoo Maps Europe and Yahoo Answers.</p>
        <p>He's written two and contributed to three books on JavaScript, web development and accessibility, lead distributed teams as a manager and made them work with one another and released dozens of online articles and hundreds of blog posts in the last few years.</p>
        <p>He's been nominated standards champion of the year 2008 by .net magazine in the UK and currently sports the fashionable job title "International Developer Evangelist" spending his time going from conference to conference and university to university to speak and train people on systems provided by Yahoo and other web companies that want to make this web thing work well for everybody.</p>

          <h3>Frontloaded and zipped up - do loose types sink ships?</h3>
          <p>JavaScript had a bumpy ride up to now, from its origins as a CGI-replacement, initiator of countless popups and annoying effects over the renaissance as Ajax enabler up to becoming wrapped up in libraries to work around the hell that is browser differences.</p>
          <p>With the ubiquity of JavaScript comes a new challenge. How do we keep JavaScript safe when browsers don't really distinguish between different sources and give them all the same rights? Why do we still judge the usefulness of JavaScript by how badly browsers speak it?</p>
          <p>Learn about some environments you can use JavaScript in securely and marvel at the magic and annoyances that are technologies that try to put a lock on the issue of JavaScript security.</p>

        <p>Peter-Paul Koch is a freelance front-end consultant, agent, and trainer in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. He has won international renown with his <a href="http://quirksmode.org/compatibility.html">browser compatibility research</a>, frequently speaks at conferences, has founded <a href="http://fronteers.nl">Fronteers</a>, the Dutch association of front-end professionals, and advises browser vendors on their implementation of the web standards.</p>

          <h3>W3C Widgets</h3>
          <p>In this session we'll discuss W3C Widgets and why they are the future of the mobile Web. We'll also take a look at various practical problems that surround the creation of W3C Widgets and mobile websites. Although web developers are well prepared for many of the browser incompatibilities they're sure to encounter, there are some special problems that occur only on mobile devices. We will discuss these problems.</p>

          <p>If the mobile web is new to you you'll be shocked by the sheer size of the problems mobile devices create, and the sheer depth of our ignorance. Nonetheless, there is a thin ray of light at the end of the tunnel, and we'll end on a more positive note by looking to the future.</p>

        <p>Jake worked on the BBC's Glow JavaScript library, talking about: <em>Optimising where it hurts</em>.</p>
        <p>Jake Archibald is a client-side web developer at the BBC working on Glow, a JavaScript library developed to meet the corporation’s design and accessibility standards. He also works with the BBC’s working groups which research and develop the corporation's technical Standards &amp; Guidelines.</p>
        <p>Outside of the BBC, Jake is a keen photographer, photoshopper, and keeps in touch with his previous life as a Flash &amp; PHP developer.</p>
        <section class="talk">
          <h3>Optimising where it hurts</h3>
          <p>As the amount of JavaScript we use on our pages increases, as does its effect on page performance. Even when browsers manage to produce the same output, how they reach that output can be very different. Some optimisations aren’t obvious, others can be easily broken by seemingly unrelated statements. So, how do we get the most out of our code?</p>

          <p>In this session we'll challenge assumptions about performance, using practical code to demonstrate the optimisations that really make a difference, and why they make a difference.</p>
